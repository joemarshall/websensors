title: Sensing Humans and their Activities
---

In this section, I discuss one of the most common uses of sensing hardware, to understand humans and their activities.

Sensors can be used to understand a wide range of aspects of human activity. I break them down here using a framework from 
[Mueller et al. 2011](#desspo). 

{%include figure.html url="/images/fourlenses.png" alt="The human body can be studied (and sensed) from a range of perspectives." title="Four lenses for understanding human activity" caption="Four possible ways of understanding humans (from Mueller et al. (2011) )" %}

Figure 1 shows four aspects of human behaviour which Mueller et al. describe. Understanding each of these aspects of behaviour may require different types and approaches to sensing. In the following sections I will describe sensing technology relating to the aspects, which are:

1) [**The responding body**](sensing_humans_2.html) - sensing of how our body responds internally to stimuli. For example our heart rate and breathing may be affected by activity or by other factors such as fear.

2) [**The moving body**](sensing_humans_3.html) how we sense the motion and posture of the body itself, for example detecting running motion.

3) [**The sensing body**](sensing_humans_4.html) - many human activities involve us interacting with *things* in the external world such as devices, interfaces or other equipment.

4) [**The relating body**](sensing_humans_5.html) - humans are social creatures - this section describes sensing of moments when humans interact together.
