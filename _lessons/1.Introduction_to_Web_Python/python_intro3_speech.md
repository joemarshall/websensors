To use:
```python
import speech 

```

<div id="speech" class="moduletarget" markdown=1>
# Module speech
```python
# Say these words as text-to-speech
def say(words)

```
</div>
<a id="speech_say" class="fntarget"></a>

# [*speech*](#speech).say
```python
# speech.say
def say(
    words
)
```
Say these words as text-to-speech

They will be spoken on the loudspeaker of your device (or whatever audio output you
have connected.)

This is useful for things like making yourself aware of sensor event detections.
