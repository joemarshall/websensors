title: PyDocs - speech module

To use:
```python
import speech 

```

A module for making your computer (or phone) talk. Useful for getting output when you can't see the screen well.
<div id="speech" class="moduletarget" markdown=1>
# Module speech
```python
# Say the words 
def say(words)

```
</div>
<a id="speech_say" class="fntarget"></a>

# [*speech*](#speech).say
```python
# speech.say
def say(
    words
)
```
Say the words 

They will be spoken on the loudspeaker of your device (or whatever audio output you
have connected.)

This is useful for things like making yourself aware of sensor event detections.
