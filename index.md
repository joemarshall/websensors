title: Joe's Sensor Processing Interactive Teaching Stuff
---

This webpage contains an introduction to sensor data and sensor processing including a bunch of interactive sensor processing examples. It is primarily intended for students on the COMP4036 Mixed Reality Technology course at Nottingham University School of Computer Science. 

Any questions, email [Joe Marshall](mailto:joe.marshall@nottingham.ac.uk).

# Combining sensors
By combining multiple sensors with different characteristics, we may be able to better understand the world. Here we will talk about how you might do that...

# Machine learning for sensor processing
In this section I will discuss machine learning approaches to sensor processing and interpretation. These are the state of the art in terms of getting the most out of the data produced by sensors. They are however non-trivial to implement, so you may want to use the simpler filtering techniques described in the previous sections in your coursework if you are not a confident programmer already...
